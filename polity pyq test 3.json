The country is split up into separate geographical areas known as constituencies, and the electors can cast one vote each for a candidate (although most candidatesstand as independents, most successful candidates stand as members of political parties), the winner being the candidate who gets the maximum votes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hare system :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It is a voting system that uses a ballot to rank candidates in order of preference. It&rsquo;s also known as ranked choice voting, instant runoff voting (IRV), or single transferable vote (STV).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cumulative voting :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It is a type of voting system that helps strengthen the ability of minority shareholders to elect a director. This method allows shareholders to cast all of their votes for a single nominee for the board of directors when the company has multiple openings on its board.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The First Past the Post System :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It is also known as the simple majority system or plurality system. In this voting system, the candidate with the most votes in a constituency is declared elected. Examples of FPTP in India include direct elections to the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies.</li>\r\n\t<li>In the electoral race, the candidate who is ahead of others and crosses the winning post first is the winner.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Plural voting&nbsp;:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It is the practice whereby one person might be able to vote multiple times in an election. It is not to be confused with a&nbsp;plurality voting system which does not necessarily involve plural voting.&nbsp;Weighted voting is a generalisation of plural voting.</li>\r\n</ul>","solution_image_1":"","solution_image_2":"","solution_video":"","difficulty_level":"1","topic":"","exam":"","section_id":"304","subject":"","concept":"","report_count":"0","set_no":"1","positive_marks":"2.00","negative_marks":"0.66","sortingparam":"0.00","question_heading":"","directive":"","deleted":"0","image_check":"0"},{"id":"44735","test_series_id":"19","test_id":"424","question_type":"1","question_ui_type":"1","question":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Which of the following is/are extra- constitutional and extra legal device(s) for securing cooperation and coordination between the States in India? <strong>(UPSC Prelims&nbsp;1995)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp; The National Development Council</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;The Governors&rsquo; Conference</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;Zonal Councils</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;The Inter State Council</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose the correct answer from the codes given below:</p>","option_1":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>1, 2 and 3&nbsp;</p>","option_2":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>1, 3 and 4</p>","option_3":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>3 and 4</p>","option_4":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>4 only</p>","option_5":"","option_6":"","option_7":"","option_8":"","option_9":"","option_10":"","option_image_1":"","option_image_2":"","option_image_3":"","option_image_4":"","option_image_5":"","option_image_6":"","option_image_7":"","option_image_8":"","option_image_9":"","option_image_10":"","image_link_1":"","image_link_2":"","image_link_3":"","answer":"1","solution_heading":"Full Solution","solution_text":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p><strong>EXPLANATION : (A)&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Constitutional body:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>They are bodies which find considerable mention in the constitution, in ways like having a part of the constitution or an article explaining their position.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Extra Constitutional Body:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>they are those bodies which do not find mention in the constitution.

Other examples are - National Human Rights Commission, Lokpal, CBI, Zonal Council.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Executive bodies:-</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>they are those bodies which are created by an executive order i.e. order of a ministry of union or state. Such bodies have no constitutional or law backing them. One very infamous body was Planning commission (now replaced by NITI aayog).</li>\r\n\t<li>Other such bodies are UIDAI (Aadhar card), which when faced controversy is undergoing shift to statutory body.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(1) The National Development Council (NDC) :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It was not provided for in the Constitution; it was set up by an executive order in 1952. It was meant to strengthen and mobilize the effort and resources of the nation in support of the Five-Year Plans and to promote cooperation between the Centre and the States.</li>\r\n\t<li>Since it was created by an executive resolution (not a constitutional or statutory provision), it is called an extra-constitutional and extralegal body.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(2) The Governors&rsquo; Conference :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It is also an extra-constitutional and informal platform where the President and the Governors discuss national and administrative issues for better coordination between the Centre and the States.</li>\r\n\t<li>It has no mention in the Constitution or in any law, and therefore it is also an extra-constitutional and extralegal device for cooperation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(3) The Zonal Councils :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>They were established under the provisions of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, which came into effect on 1st November 1956. They were created to promote cooperation and coordination among States and between the Centre and the States &mdash; especially after the reorganisation of states on a linguistic basis.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Zonal Councils are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution of India. They were not created under any Article of the Constitution, but rather by an Act of Parliament (a statute). Hence, they are called extra-constitutional bodies &mdash; meaning, they exist outside the framework of the Constitution.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(4) The Inter-State Council :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It is a constitutional body established under Article 263 of the Indian Constitution.

This is according to Article 131 of the Constitution of India.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Supreme Court has six types of jurisdiction:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Original&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Appellate&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Advisory&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Review&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Inherent&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Extraordinary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Original jurisdiction&rdquo; ;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>&nbsp;It refers to the power of a court to hear a case first, before any other court.

Advisory Jurisdiction :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s advisory jurisdiction is when a constitutional body or lower court seeks advice from a higher court on a legal matter.</li>\r\n\t<li>Article 143 of the Indian Constitution gives the Supreme Court advisory jurisdiction. This allows the President to ask for the Supreme Court&rsquo;s opinion on any issue of law or matter of public importance.</li>\r\n\t<li>For example, the President can ask the Court&rsquo;s opinion on treaties and agreements made before the Constitution was framed.

Appellate Jurisdiction :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The Supreme Court of India has a broad appellate jurisdiction over all courts and tribunals in the country.

proportions such as a certain percentage or half of the total seats, hence option 1 and 2 (21 and 14 seats which are half and one third respectively) are incorrect.</li>\r\n\t<li>For option 3, there is no rule of allocating one-sixth of total seats to SC in any state, hence it is also incorrect.</li>\r\n\t<li>Option 4 indicates 6 seats allocated to the Scheduled Castes and this could be correct depending upon the demographic composition of the state.</li>\r\n\t<li>The exact number can only be determined considering the population of SC in the state relative to the total population, hence without that specific information, the answer could not be definitively confirmed.</li>\r\n\t<li>Thus, the correct answer indicated is option 4, but this is under the assumption that the Scheduled

judge. Tribunal judges oversee specific areas of law and handle specialized or technical matters. Their activities are not confined to a specific geographical jurisdiction like a district.</li>\r\n\t<li>According to the Constitution of India, a person to be eligible for appointment as a District Judge should be an advocates or a pleader of seven years&rsquo; standing or more.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tribunals in India :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>They are quasi-judicial bodies that resolve disputes related to administration, taxation, environment, and securities. They are adjudicatory bodies that serve as an alternative to the traditional court system.</li>\r\n\t<li>Tribunals are established by law and are intended to provide a faster adjudication platform than traditional courts. They also provide expertise on certain subject matters.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some examples of tribunals in India include:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.

Competition Appellate Tribunal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Debts Recovery Tribunal</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tribunals have certain powers, including:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;Discovery and production of documents</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Reception of evidence on affidavits</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Requisitioning of public records from any court or office</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Issuing of any commission for the examination of witnesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The Tribunal Reforms Bill, 2021 was passed in both Houses of the Parliament in August 2021. The bill replaced the ordinance which had been introduced in February 2021.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sessions judge :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>He is a judge who presides over a sessions court. The sessions court is the most powerful court in a district for criminal cases.</li>\r\n\t<li>The district and sessions judge is often referred to as &ldquo;district judge&rdquo; when presiding over civil matters and &ldquo;sessions judge&rdquo; when presiding over criminal matters. The district and sessions judge works directly under the control of the governor of the state.</li>\r\n\t<li>The CrPC enables sessions judges to pass any sentence authorized by law. The high court may appoint a sessions judge of one sessions division to also be an additional sessions judge of another division.</li>\r\n</ul>","solution_image_1":"","solution_image_2":"","solution_video":"","difficulty_level":"1","topic":"","exam":"","section_id":"304","subject":"","concept":"","report_count":"0","set_no":"1","positive_marks":"2.00","negative_marks":"0.66","sortingparam":"0.00","question_heading":"","directive":"","deleted":"0","image_check":"0"},{"id":"44751","test_series_id":"19","test_id":"424","question_type":"1","question_ui_type":"1","question":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>When the Chief Justice of a High Court acts in an administrative capacity, he is subject to...........<strong> (UPSC Prelims&nbsp;1996)</strong></p>","option_1":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>the writ jurisdiction of any of the other judges of the High Court</p>","option_2":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>special control exercised by the Chief Justice of India</p>","option_3":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>discretionary powers of the Governor of the state&nbsp;</p>","option_4":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>special powers provided to the Chief Minister in this regard</p>","option_5":"","option_6":"","option_7":"","option_8":"","option_9":"","option_10":"","option_image_1":"","option_image_2":"","option_image_3":"","option_image_4":"","option_image_5":"","option_image_6":"","option_image_7":"","option_image_8":"","option_image_9":"","option_image_10":"","image_link_1":"","image_link_2":"","image_link_3":"","answer":"1","solution_heading":"Full Solution","solution_text":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p><strong>EXPLANATION : (A)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>When the chief justice of a High Court acts in an administrative capacity, he is subject to.

It can also include conduct that interferes with the orderly administration of justice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Examples of contempt of court include:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Disrupting court proceedings</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Interfering with attempts to obtain evidence</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Destroying evidence</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Disobeying a court order</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Intimidating witnesses</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Being impolite to legal authorities in the courtroom</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Rebelliously failing to follow a court order</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>In India, the Parliament has the power to make laws on contempt of court. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 defines contempt of court as civil contempt or criminal contempt.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Civil contempt of court :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It occurs when someone fails to comply with a court order, which can harm the justice system or a private individual or party.</li>\r\n\t<li>Civil contempt of court carries quasi-criminal penalties, rather than direct criminal penalties. Criminal contempt of court is behavior that disrespects, offends, or disobeys the authority of a court. It can occur directly or indirectly, in the presence of the court or outside of it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here are some examples of criminal contempt of court:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Insulting the judge</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Creating a disturbance at trial</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Disrupting court proceedings</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Interfering with attempts to obtain evidence</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Criminal contempt can also include any act or publication that:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Scandalizes the court</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Prejudices any judicial proceeding</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Interferes with the administration of justice in any other manner</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Judicial activism :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It is a legal term that describes when judges make rulings based on their personal or political views, rather than on current legislation.</li>\r\n\t<li>It can also refer to when judges let their personal feelings influence a conviction or sentence.

This amendment was meant to uphold the dignity of national symbols. <strong>Thus, statement 1 is correct.</strong></li>\r\n\t<li>The 1996 Amendment Act increased the security deposit amounts for contesting elections to both the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies. This was done to discourage non-serious candidates from filing nominations.</li>\r\n\t<li>For example, the Lok Sabha deposit was raised from ₹500 to ₹10,000 for general candidates, and from ₹250 to ₹5,000 for Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates. <strong>Thus, statement 2 is correct.</strong></li>\r\n\t<li>This statement is wrong because the 1996 amendment did not prohibit multiple constituency contests. A candidate was still allowed to contest from a maximum of two constituencies (as per Section 33(7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951).</li>\r\n\t<li>The restriction to only one constituency came much later &mdash; it has been recommended by the Election Commission but not implemented in the 1996 amendment. <strong>So, statement 3 is incorrect.</strong></li>\r\n\t<li>Before the 1996 amendment, if a candidate died after nominations were finalized, the election was countermanded (cancelled) and re-conducted later.</li>\r\n\t<li>The 1996 amendment changed this rule, stating that elections would no longer be countermanded on the death of a candidate; instead, the poll would continue with the remaining candidates. This ensured that elections would not be delayed unnecessarily.<strong> Thus, statement 4 is correct.</strong> <strong>Therefore the correct answer is B.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>","solution_image_1":"","solution_image_2":"","solution_video":"","difficulty_level":"1","topic":"","exam":"","section_id":"304","subject":"","concept":"","report_count":"0","set_no":"1","positive_marks":"2.00","negative_marks":"0.66","sortingparam":"0.00","question_heading":"","directive":"","deleted":"0","image_check":"0"},{"id":"44779","test_series_id":"19","test_id":"424","question_type":"1","question_ui_type":"1","question":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Consider the following statements: An amendment of the Constitution of India can be initiated by the............ <strong>(UPSC Prelims&nbsp;1999)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(1) Lok Sabha</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2) Rajya Sabha</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(3) State Legislatures</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(4) President</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which of the above statements is/are correct?</p>","option_1":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>1 alone</p>","option_2":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>1, 2 and 3</p>","option_3":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>2, 3 and 4</p>","option_4":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>1 and 2</p>","option_5":"","option_6":"","option_7":"","option_8":"","option_9":"","option_10":"","option_image_1":"","option_image_2":"","option_image_3":"","option_image_4":"","option_image_5":"","option_image_6":"","option_image_7":"","option_image_8":"","option_image_9":"","option_image_10":"","image_link_1":"","image_link_2":"","image_link_3":"","answer":"4","solution_heading":"Full Solution","solution_text":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p><strong>EXPLANATION : (D)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A minister or private member can initiate an amendment to the Constitution of India by introducing a bill in either House of Parliament.

The NHRC&rsquo;s mission is to protect and promote human rights. The NHRC is responsible for the protection and promotion of human rights, which are defined as &ldquo;Rights Relating To Life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual&rdquo;.</li>\r\n\t<li>These rights are guaranteed by the constitution or embodied in the international covenants and enforceable by courts in India. The NHRC is located at New Delhi.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Commission consists of a Chairperson, five full-time Members, and seven deemed Members. The chairman and members hold office for a term of three years or until they attain the age of 70 years, whichever is earlier.</li>\r\n\t<li>The NHRC is in conformity with the Paris Principles, adopted at the first international workshop on national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights held in Paris in October 1991.</li>\r\n\t<li>Arun Kumar Mishra is the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission of India. The chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) must be a former or current judge of the Supreme Court of India. The NHRC also includes one member who is or has been a Supreme Court judge, and one member who is or has been a High Court Chief Justice.</li>\r\n\t<li>The president can remove the chairperson or any member of the NHRC from office if they are found to be incapable or have misbehaved. As of December 2018, 26 states have set up State Human Rights Commissions (SHRCs). The NHRC has requested all states, including Uttaranchal and Jharkhand, to set up SHRCs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The following states have not constituted SHRCs:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Haryana, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Uttarakhand.

When workers feel like they are partners in the development process, they are more likely to be motivated and engaged.</li>\r\n\t<li>This can lead to better outcomes for the community as a whole. The passage also highlights the importance of including women in the development process.

Zila Parishads at the sub-divisional level &rarr; Assam (2) In Assam, the Panchayati Raj structure differs slightly from the regular three-tier system. Here, the Zila Parishad functions at the sub-divisional level, not strictly at the district level as in other states. Assam&rsquo;s local body system has evolved based on administrative convenience, hence this match.</li>\r\n\t<li>B. Mandal Praja Parishad &rarr; Andhra Pradesh (1) In Andhra Pradesh, the intermediate tier of Panchayati Raj is known as the Mandal Praja Parishad, instead of the commonly used &ldquo;Panchayat Samiti.&rdquo; The 73rd Amendment allows states to name their institutions differently, and Andhra Pradesh adopted this terminology.</li>\r\n\t<li>C. Tribal Councils &rarr; Mizoram (3) Mizoram is a Sixth Schedule area, where traditional tribal self-governance institutions function instead of the regular Panchayati Raj system. Local governance is carried out through Autonomous District Councils and Tribal Councils, which manage local affairs in accordance with tribal customs.</li>\r\n\t<li>D. Absence of Village Panchayats &rarr; Meghalaya (4) In Meghalaya, there are no traditional Village Panchayats as found in other states. Instead, governance in rural areas is handled by traditional tribal institutions such as Dorbar Shnongs, Syiems, and Nokmas under the Sixth Schedule framework. Thus, the state shows an absence of the formal Panchayati Raj system. <strong>Thus, the correct answer is (D) 2 1 3 4.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>","solution_image_1":"","solution_image_2":"","solution_video":"","difficulty_level":"1","topic":"","exam":"","section_id":"304","subject":"","concept":"","report_count":"0","set_no":"1","positive_marks":"2.00","negative_marks":"0.66","sortingparam":"0.00","question_heading":"","directive":"","deleted":"0","image_check":"0"},{"id":"44793","test_series_id":"19","test_id":"424","question_type":"1","question_ui_type":"1","question":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Which one of the following statements is incorrect? <strong>(UPSC Prelims&nbsp;2000)</strong></p>","option_1":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Goa attained full statehood in 1987</p>","option_2":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Diu is an island in the Gulf of Khambhat</p>","option_3":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Daman and Diu were separated from Goa by the 56th Amendment of the Constitution of India</p>","option_4":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Dadra and Nagar Haveli were under French colonial rule till 1954</p>","option_5":"","option_6":"","option_7":"","option_8":"","option_9":"","option_10":"","option_image_1":"","option_image_2":"","option_image_3":"","option_image_4":"","option_image_5":"","option_image_6":"","option_image_7":"","option_image_8":"","option_image_9":"","option_image_10":"","image_link_1":"","image_link_2":"","image_link_3":"","answer":"4","solution_heading":"Full Solution","solution_text":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p><strong>EXPLANATION : (D)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The correct answer is Option 4 i.e., Dadar &amp; Nagar Haveli were under French colonial rule till 1954.

However, it does outline the rights of minorities, which are based on religion or language. The National Commission for Minorities (NCM) is a statutory body established by the Indian parliament in 1992. The NCM was established on May 17, 1993, and the first statutory commission was set up on that day. The National Commission for Minorities Act of 1992 identifies the following communities as minorities: ∙ Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains, Zoroastrians (Parsis). According to the 2011 Census, minorities make up about 19.3% of India&rsquo;s population. According to the 2011 census, the smallest religious minority in India is Jains, making up 0.4% of the population. According to the Exam year, the Zoroastrians are the smallest religious minority in India. They are concentrated in Maharashtra. The Constitution of India recognizes and protects religious and linguistic minorities. Article 29 of the Constitution protects the interests of minority groups. It gives citizens with a distinct language, script, or culture the right to preserve their culture, language, and script. It also gives linguistic minorities the right to establish their own educational institutions. Article 30 of the Constitution gives religious and linguistic minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. It also protects minority-managed educational institutions from discrimination in receiving aid from the state. An ethnic, religious, or linguistic minority is any group of people who make up less than half of a state&rsquo;s population. The members of these groups share common characteristics of culture, religion, or language.</p>","solution_image_1":"","solution_image_2":"","solution_video":"","difficulty_level":"1","topic":"","exam":"","section_id":"304","subject":"","concept":"","report_count":"0","set_no":"1","positive_marks":"2.00","negative_marks":"0.66","sortingparam":"0.00","question_heading":"","directive":"","deleted":"0","image_check":"0"},{"id":"44795","test_series_id":"19","test_id":"424","question_type":"1","question_ui_type":"1","question":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>In what way does the Indian Parliament exercise control over the administration? <strong>(UPSC Prelims&nbsp;2001)</strong></p>","option_1":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Through Consultative Committees of various ministries</p>","option_2":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Through Parliamentary Committees</p>","option_3":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>By making the administrators send periodic reports</p>","option_4":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>By compelling the executive to issue writs</p>","option_5":"","option_6":"","option_7":"","option_8":"","option_9":"","option_10":"","option_image_1":"","option_image_2":"","option_image_3":"","option_image_4":"","option_image_5":"","option_image_6":"","option_image_7":"","option_image_8":"","option_image_9":"","option_image_10":"","image_link_1":"","image_link_2":"","image_link_3":"","answer":"2","solution_heading":"Full Solution","solution_text":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><p>EXPLANATION : (B) T he Indian Parliament exercises control over the administration through a number of methods, including: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

The CAG acts as the guardian of the public purse and ensures accountability of the executive to the legislature in matters of public finance. His main function is to audit the accounts of the Union and the States and report to the President or Governors, who then place these reports before the . The CAG audits and reports on all expenditures from the Consolidated Fund of India, which includes all revenues received by the Government of India, loans raised, and money received in repayment of loans. This is explicitly mentioned in Article 149 of the Constitution and the CAG&rsquo;s (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971. In addition to the Consolidated Fund, the CAG also audits the Contingency Fund of India (used for urgent, unforeseen expenditures) and the Public Account of India (which holds funds such as provident funds, judicial deposits, etc.). Thus, this is also a function legally assigned to the CAG. The CAG is empowered to audit the accounts of government departments engaged in commercial or manufacturing activities, such as government companies or corporations. He prepares and submits reports on their trading, manufacturing, profit, and loss accounts to ensure transparency and accountability. To control the receipt and issue of public money, and to ensure that the public revenue is lodged in the exchequer &mdash; This function belongs to the executive branch (mainly the Finance Ministry and Treasury officers), not to the CAG. The CAG&rsquo;s role is not to control financial transactions in real time but to audit them after they occur &mdash; i.e., he performs a post-facto audit. Therefore, while the CAG ensures that funds are used properly and in accordance with law, he does not control or supervise the day-to-day receipt and expenditure of government money.

The amendment also established a 70-member legislativeassembly and a 7-member council of ministers for Delhi. The amendment also designated the administrator of Delhi as the Lieutenant Governor (LG).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The 75th Amendment of the Indian Constitution :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Which was enforced on May 15, 1994, modifies Article 323B. It establishes State level Rent Tribunals to limit the jurisdiction of all courts, except the Supreme Court, under Article 136 of the Constitution. T he 75th Amendment also addresses rent, its regulation and control, and tenancy issues, including the right, title, and interest of landlords and tenants.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The 80th Amendment to the Indian Constitution :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Officially known as the Constitution (Eightieth Amendment) Act, 1999, was enacted to implement the Tenth Finance Commission&rsquo;s recommendation to streamline the tax systems. The amendment&rsquo;s goal is to collect and distribute all taxes between the states and the federal government. The 80th Amendment made changes to article 270, which relates to the divisible pool.</li>\r\n\t<li>After the amendment, Article 270 provides for sharing all the taxes and duties referred to in the Union list. The 80th Amendment Act also enacted an alternative scheme of devolution of revenue for sharing taxes between the Union and the State.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The 83rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2000 :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It&nbsp;was enacted to introduce a special exception for the State of Arunachal Pradesh in the matter of reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) in Panchayati Raj Institutions.</li>\r\n\t<li>Normally, under Article 243D(1) of the Constitution (inserted by the 73rd Amendment, 1992), it is mandatory to reserve seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in every Panchayat at all levels &mdash; in proportion to their population in the area. This ensures representation of weaker sections in local governance.</li>\r\n\t<li>However, in the case of Arunachal Pradesh, this provision was found to be unnecessary and practically inapplicable, because the Scheduled Caste population in the state is almost negligible (less than 0.1%).</li>\r\n\t<li>On the other hand, almost the entire population of the state belongs to various Scheduled Tribes &mdash; meaning reservation for SCs would serve no real purpose and would complicate local governance.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><canvas height=\"18\" width=\"18\"></canvas></p>","solution_image_1":"","solution_image_2":"","solution_video":"","difficulty_level":"1","topic":"","exam":"","section_id":"304","subject":"","concept":"","report_count":"0","set_no":"1","positive_marks":"2.00","negative_marks":"0.66","sortingparam":"0.00","question_heading":"","directive":"","deleted":"0","image_check":"0"},{"id":"44803","test_series_id":"19","test_id":"424","question_type":"1","question_ui_type":"1","question":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Consider the following statements regarding the political parties in India............<strong>&nbsp;(UPSC Prelims&nbsp;2001)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(1) The Representation of the People Act, 1951 provides for the registration of political parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2) Registration of political parties is carried out by the Election Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(3) A national level political party is one which is recognised in four or more States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(4) During the 1999 general elections, there were six National and 48 State level parties recognised by the Election Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which of these statements are correct?</p>","option_1":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>1, 2 and 4&nbsp;</p>","option_2":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>1 and 3</p>","option_3":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>2 and 4</p>","option_4":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>1, 2, 3 and 4</p>","option_5":"","option_6":"","option_7":"","option_8":"","option_9":"","option_10":"","option_image_1":"","option_image_2":"","option_image_3":"","option_image_4":"","option_image_5":"","option_image_6":"","option_image_7":"","option_image_8":"","option_image_9":"","option_image_10":"","image_link_1":"","image_link_2":"","image_link_3":"","answer":"4","solution_heading":"Full Solution","solution_text":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p><strong>EXPLANATION : (D)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I.&nbsp;&ldquo;The Representation of the People Act, 1951 provides for the registration of political parties.&rdquo;

Article 30(1) provides special rights to minorities&mdash;both religious and linguistic&mdash;to preserve their culture through education.</li>\r\n\t<li>This right enables them to establish schools or colleges that reflect their values and traditions. So, C &rarr; 3. Originally, Article 31 guaranteed the Right to Property as a fundamental right. Article 31(1) stated that property could only be taken by lawful means. However, after the 44th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1978, the Right to Property was removed from Fundamental Rights and placed under Article 300A in Part XII as a legal right. Still, Article 31(1) historically had this wording. So, D &rarr; 1. <strong>Thus, the correct answer is (A) 2 4 3 1.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><canvas height=\"18\" width=\"18\"></canvas></p>","solution_image_1":"","solution_image_2":"","solution_video":"","difficulty_level":"1","topic":"","exam":"","section_id":"304","subject":"","concept":"","report_count":"0","set_no":"1","positive_marks":"2.00","negative_marks":"0.66","sortingparam":"0.00","question_heading":"","directive":"","deleted":"0","image_check":"0"},{"id":"44808","test_series_id":"19","test_id":"424","question_type":"1","question_ui_type":"1","question":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Which one of the following rights was described by Dr BR Ambedkar as the heartand soul of the Constitution?<strong> (UPSC Prelims&nbsp;2002)</strong></p>","option_1":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Right to freedom of religion</p>","option_2":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Right to property</p>","option_3":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Right to equality</p>","option_4":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Right to Constitutional remedies</p>","option_5":"","option_6":"","option_7":"","option_8":"","option_9":"","option_10":"","option_image_1":"","option_image_2":"","option_image_3":"","option_image_4":"","option_image_5":"","option_image_6":"","option_image_7":"","option_image_8":"","option_image_9":"","option_image_10":"","image_link_1":"","image_link_2":"","image_link_3":"","answer":"4","solution_heading":"Full Solution","solution_text":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p><strong>EXPLANATION : (D)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the chairman of the drafting committee for the Indian Constitution, described the Right to Constitutional Remedies as the &ldquo;heart and soul&rdquo; of the Constitution.

This ensures that each MP&rsquo;s vote carries equal weight in the election.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Statement 3 is incorrect. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>In the most recent Presidential elections (like 2022), the total members of the Electoral College were:</strong> 776 MPs (543 Lok Sabha + 233 Rajya Sabha), and 4,033 MLAs, making a total of 4,809 members. Even in earlier elections, the total has always been below 5000, so this statement is factually wrong.</li>\r\n</ul>","solution_image_1":"","solution_image_2":"","solution_video":"","difficulty_level":"1","topic":"","exam":"","section_id":"304","subject":"","concept":"","report_count":"0","set_no":"1","positive_marks":"2.00","negative_marks":"0.66","sortingparam":"0.00","question_heading":"","directive":"","deleted":"0","image_check":"0"},{"id":"44831","test_series_id":"19","test_id":"424","question_type":"1","question_ui_type":"1","question":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>The power to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India with respect to any matter included in the Union List of Legislative Powers rests with............&nbsp;<strong>(UPSC Prelims&nbsp;2003)</strong></p>","option_1":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>The President of India</p>","option_2":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>The Chief Justice of India</p>","option_3":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>The Parliament</p>","option_4":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>The Union Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs</p>","option_5":"","option_6":"","option_7":"","option_8":"","option_9":"","option_10":"","option_image_1":"","option_image_2":"","option_image_3":"","option_image_4":"","option_image_5":"","option_image_6":"","option_image_7":"","option_image_8":"","option_image_9":"","option_image_10":"","image_link_1":"","image_link_2":"","image_link_3":"","answer":"3","solution_heading":"Full Solution","solution_text":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p><strong>EXPLANATION : (C)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>According to Article 138 of the Constitution of India, the Parliament can enlarge the jurisdiction and power of the Supreme Court on any matter in the Union List.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Parliament can also:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.
