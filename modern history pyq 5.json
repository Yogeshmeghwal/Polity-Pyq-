The plan suggested that all members of the Viceroy&rsquo;s Executive Council, except the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, would be Indians.</li>\r\n\t<li>The plan also suggested that all portfolios, including that of War Members, would be held by Indian leaders. The Simla conference was held in 1945 under the presidency of Lord Wavell and Indian political leaders.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Simon Commission :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It is also known as the Indian Statutory Commission, was a group of seven British Parliament members who studied constitutional reform in India in 1927. The commission was appointed by the British Conservative government in November 1927 to report on the working of the Indian constitution. The commission&rsquo;s chairman was Sir John Simon.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Simon Commission&rsquo;s recommendations included giving more autonomy to Indian provincial governments, but keeping a veto for the Viceroy. The Simon Report was important in the constitutional discussion that led to the Government of India Act of 1935.</li>\r\n\t<li>The commission was boycotted by Indians because all its members were Englishmen and the commission had no Indian member. The slogan &ldquo;Simon Go Back&rdquo; became one of the most enduring slogans of the Indian freedom struggle.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Cripps Mission :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It was a meeting between British government representatives and Indian leaders that took place from March 22 to April 11, 1942. The mission&rsquo;s purpose was to secure Indian cooperation and support for the British war efforts in World War II. The mission&rsquo;s proposals were constitutional and sought Indian support.</li>\r\n\t<li>The mission was organized by Sir Richard Stafford Cripps, a member of the War Cabinet.</li>\r\n\t<li>The mission failed and the issue of India&rsquo;s constitution was postponed until the end of the war. The mission&rsquo;s failure led to the Quit India Movement, a countrywide strike wave that involved workers, peasants, and states&rsquo; peoples.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The mission&rsquo;s proposals included:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Establishing the Indian Union</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Allowing India to participate in international bodies and the United Nations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The Constituent Assembly would have members nominated by the Provincial Assemblies as well as the Princely States</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Any Province, which is not prepared to accept the new Constitution would have the right to sign a separate agreement with Britain regarding its future status</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The Muslim League criticized the idea of a single Indian Union. They also stated that the proposals denied the Muslims the right to self-determination and the creation of Pakistan.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Cabinet Mission Plan :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It was a proposal put forward by the British Cabinet Mission in 1946 to address the issue of Indian independence. It recommended the creation of a united India with a federal structure, granting significant autonomy to provinces, while ensuring protections for minorities. However, it failed to gain acceptance from Indian political leaders and ultimately led to the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan.</li>\r\n</ul>","solution_image_1":"","solution_image_2":"","solution_video":"","difficulty_level":"1","topic":"","exam":"","section_id":"313","subject":"","concept":"","report_count":"0","set_no":"1","positive_marks":"2.00","negative_marks":"0.66","sortingparam":"0.00","question_heading":"","directive":"","deleted":"0","image_check":"0"},{"id":"44410","test_series_id":"19","test_id":"420","question_type":"1","question_ui_type":"1","question":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>During the Indian Freedom Struggle, Who of the following raised an army called &lsquo;Free Indian Legion&rdquo;? <strong>(UPSC Prelims&nbsp;2008)</strong></p>","option_1":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Lala Hardayal&nbsp;</p>","option_2":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Rashbehari Bose</p>","option_3":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Subhas Chandra Bose</p>","option_4":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>V.

Excessive taxes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. A plague outbreak that made them unable to work</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. A severe drought that led to crop failures</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Widespread distress among peasant communities</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Satyagraha is a form of nonviolent resistance or civil resistance that means &ldquo;holding firmly to truth&rdquo; or &ldquo;truth force&rdquo;. Gandhi developed the term and practiced it in the Indian independence movement and in his earlier struggles in South Africa for Indian rights.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Permanent Settlement :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It is also known as the Permanent Settlement of Bengal, was an agreement between the East India Company and the landlords of Bengal in 1793. The agreement was part of the Cornwallis Code, a larger body of legislation that divided the East India Company&rsquo;s service personnel into three branches.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Permanent Settlement had several features:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. The agreement established a fixed amount of revenue to be collected from land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. The agreement stated that the amount to be given to the government was fixed permanently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The agreement gave zamindars the power to collect revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. The agreement recognized zamindars as the permanent owners of the land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. The agreement instructed zamindars to pay 89% of the annual revenue to the state and keep 11% as their share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. The agreement encouraged zamindars to invest in improving lands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. The agreement created an Indian landed class that supported British authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The Permanent Settlement was first enacted in Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha in 1793 by the Governor-General Lord Cornwallis. It was later followed in the presidency of northern Madras and in the Varanasi district.

It also supported a more rational and reformist approach to religion, and did not uphold the infallibility of the Vedas.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Hence statement 3 is not correct.</strong> Debendranath Tagore, the father of Rabindranath Tagore, was a key member of the Brahmo Sabha. In 1843 he was involved in the creation of the Brahmo Samaj.</li>\r\n\t<li>Keshub Chunder Sen, a disciple of Tagore, joined the Samaj in 1857 but broke away in a formal schism in 1866.

The act gave the police the power to arrest anyone without cause.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Rowlatt Act was met with opposition from Indians, who saw it as undemocratic and oppressive. The act also strengthened police powers and limited freedom of expression.</li>\r\n\t<li>Mahatma Gandhi called for a non-violent Satyagraha against the act, which began on April 6, 1919.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Khilafat Movement :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It was a political campaign that ran from 1919&ndash;1924. It was a pan-Islamic movement led by Indian Muslims to pressure the British government to preserve the Ottoman Sultan&rsquo;s authority as Caliph of Islam. The movement&rsquo;s goal was to save the Ottoman caliph as a symbol of unity among the Muslim community in India.</li>\r\n\t<li>The movement was initially supported by Gandhi&rsquo;s noncooperation movement. However, it fell apart after the abolition of the caliphate in 1924. The movement was abruptly called off on February 12, 1922, at Gandhiji&rsquo;s insistence, proceeding with the news of the Chauri Chaura incident.</li>\r\n\t<li>The term &ldquo;caliph&rdquo; (khalifah in Arabic) is generally regarded to mean &ldquo;successor of the prophet Muhammad,&rdquo; while &ldquo;caliphate&rdquo; (khilafah in Arabic) denotes the office of the political leader of the Muslim community (ummah) or state.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Vernacular Press Act :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It was a law passed in 1878 in British India to limit the freedom of the Indian-language press. The act was also known as &ldquo;The Gagging Act&rdquo;.</li>\r\n\t<li>The act was proposed by Lord Lytton, who was the viceroy of India from 1876 1880. The act was intended to prevent the vernacular press from criticizing British policies, especially the opposition that grew during the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878&ndash;1880). The act did not apply to English-language publications.</li>\r\n\t<li>The act was modeled on the Irish Press laws and gave the government the power to censor reports and editorials in the Vernacular Press. The act also allowed the British government to confiscate newspaper assets, including printing presses and other media.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The act violated freedom of expression in the following ways: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.

Joseph Baptista served as the President and N.C. Kelkar was appointed as the secretary of the movement.</li>\r\n\t<li>The movement&rsquo;s signature achievement was the Montague Declaration of 1917, which recognized the inclusion of more Indians in the government and the development of self-governing institutions.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Theosophical Society was founded in 1875 by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, Henry Steel Olcott, William Quan Judge, and 16 others in New York City.

introduction of responsible Government in India.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Government of India Act of 1919 was enacted, which came into force in 1921.</li>\r\n\t<li>This Act is also known as Montagu- Chelmsford Reforms (Montagu was the Secretary of State for India and Lord Chelmsford was the Viceroy of India).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The features of this Act were as follows:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It relaxed the central control over the provinces by demarcating and separating the central and provincial subjects.</li>\r\n\t<li>The central and provincial legislatures were authorized to make laws on their respective list of subjects.</li>\r\n\t<li>The structure of the government continued to be centralized and unitary.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>It further divided the provincial subjects into two parts&ndash;</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>1. transferred and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. reserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The transferred subjects were to be administered by the Governor with the aid of Ministers responsible to the legislative council.</li>\r\n\t<li>The reserved subjects were to be administered by the Governor and his executive council without being responsible to the legislative council.</li>\r\n\t<li>This dual scheme of governance was known as &lsquo;dyarchy&rsquo;&ndash;a term derived from the Greek word diarche which means the double rule.</li>\r\n\t<li>It introduced, for the f irst time, bicameralism and direct elections in the country. The Indian legislative council was replaced by a bicameral legislature consisting of an Upper House (Council of State) and a Lower House (Legislative Assembly).</li>\r\n\t<li>The majority of members of both the Houses were chosen by direct election. It granted franchises to a limited number of people based on property, tax, or education.</li>\r\n\t<li>It required that the three of the six members of the Viceroy&rsquo;s Executive Council (other than the Commander-in-Chief) were to be Indian.</li>\r\n\t<li>It extended the principle of communal representation by providing separate electorates for Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, and Europeans.</li>\r\n\t<li>It created a new office of the High Commissioner for India in London and transferred to him some of the functions hitherto performed by the Secretary of State for India.</li>\r\n\t<li>It provided for the establishment of a public service commission.</li>\r\n\t<li>Hence, a Central Public Service Commission was set up in 1926 for recruiting civil servants. It separated, for the first time, provincial budgets from the Central budget and authorized the provincial legislatures to enact their budgets.</li>\r\n\t<li>It provided for the appointment of a statutory commission to inquire into and report on its working after ten years of its coming into force.</li>\r\n</ul>","solution_image_1":"","solution_image_2":"","solution_video":"","difficulty_level":"1","topic":"","exam":"","section_id":"313","subject":"","concept":"","report_count":"0","set_no":"1","positive_marks":"2.00","negative_marks":"0.66","sortingparam":"0.00","question_heading":"","directive":"","deleted":"0","image_check":"0"},{"id":"44470","test_series_id":"19","test_id":"420","question_type":"1","question_ui_type":"1","question":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Which one of the following movements has contributed to a split in the Indian National Congress resulting in the emergence of &lsquo;moderates&rsquo; and &lsquo;extremists&rsquo;?<strong> (UPSC Prelims&nbsp;2015)</strong></p>","option_1":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Swadeshi Movement</p>","option_2":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Quit India Movement</p>","option_3":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Non-Cooperation Movement</p>","option_4":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>Civil Disobedience Movement</p>","option_5":"","option_6":"","option_7":"","option_8":"","option_9":"","option_10":"","option_image_1":"","option_image_2":"","option_image_3":"","option_image_4":"","option_image_5":"","option_image_6":"","option_image_7":"","option_image_8":"","option_image_9":"","option_image_10":"","image_link_1":"","image_link_2":"","image_link_3":"","answer":"1","solution_heading":"Full Solution","solution_text":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation : (A)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The Indian National Congress (INC) split in 1907 into two groups, radicals and moderates, at the Surat session. The split was due to differences in their approach to British rule.</li>\r\n\t<li>The moderates opposed boycotts as a form of protest in the Swadeshi Movement. They believed that political connections with Britain were in India&rsquo;s interest and that the time wasn&rsquo;t ripe for a direct challenge to British rule.

It ended the East India Company&rsquo;s monopoly over trade with India, allowing other British merchants to trade freely in India. However, the Company retained its monopoly only over trade in tea and with China. This was done because tea and Chinese trade were still highly profitable and strategically important to the British economy.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Act made it clear that the British Crown was the sovereign authority over India, and the East India Company was merely ruling India on behalf of the Crown. Although the Company continued to administer Indian territories, this clause reaffirmed that ultimate authority rested with the British Parliament and Crown, not with the Company.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Charter Act of 1813 did not transfer control of Indian revenues to the British Parliament. The East India Company continued to control revenues and administration in India, though it operated under the supervision of the Crown and Parliament. It was only after the Government of India Act of 1858 that the control of Indian administration and revenues was directly taken over by the British Crown.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Therefore the correct answer is (A) 1 and 2 only.</strong></p>","solution_image_1":"","solution_image_2":"","solution_video":"","difficulty_level":"1","topic":"","exam":"","section_id":"313","subject":"","concept":"","report_count":"0","set_no":"1","positive_marks":"2.00","negative_marks":"0.66","sortingparam":"0.00","question_heading":"","directive":"","deleted":"0","image_check":"0"},{"id":"44503","test_series_id":"19","test_id":"420","question_type":"1","question_ui_type":"1","question":"<style>*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important} </style><style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">*{overflow-wrap: break-word;} img {max-width:100% !important}\r\n</style>\r\n<p>With reference to Swadeshi Movement consider the following statements:<strong> (UPSC Prelims&nbsp;2019)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

It was a response to the British government&rsquo;s decision to partition Bengal in 1905. The movement&rsquo;s name comes from the idea of using products and services from one&rsquo;s own country.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The movement&rsquo;s goals were to:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

Its impact can still be felt in India&rsquo;s economic policies and social structures today.</li>\r\n\t<li>National Council of Education (NCE) was established in 1906 as part of the Swadeshi Movement. The NCE was founded by Indian nationalists like Satish Chandra Mukherjee, Rabindranath Tagore, and Aurobindo Ghosh.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The NCE&rsquo;s goals were to:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

The organization&rsquo;s goal was to end untouchability in India through truth and nonviolence. The organization is also known as the Harijan Sevak Sangh.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Harijan Sevak Sangh&rsquo;s objectives were to:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. End untouchability in Hindu society</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. End the incidental evils and disabilities suffered by the so-called untouchables</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The organization is headquartered at Kingsway Camp in Delhi, with branches in 26 states across India.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sahajanand Saraswati founded the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) in 1936. The AIKS is the farmers&rsquo; wing of the Communist Party of India. The AIKS was formed to address the problems of farmers against the zamindari system.</li>\r\n\t<li>The AIKS&rsquo;s agenda had a strong influence on the Congress manifesto for the 1937 provincial elections. As the movement moved away from the Congress, it was more dominated by Socialists and Communists. By May 1942, the Communist Party of India (CPI) had gained control of the AIKS in every state of India, including Bengal.</li>\r\n\t<li>The AIKS was formed at the Indian National Congress&rsquo;s Lucknow session in April 1936.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The AIKS&rsquo;s features included:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. A kisan manifesto</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. A periodical launched under the direction of Indulal Yagnik</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, also known as Periyar, founded the Self-Respect Movement in 1925. The movement&rsquo;s goal was to create a rational society without religion, caste, or god, and to give equal human rights to oppressed castes.</li>\r\n\t<li>Periyar was a vocal critic of texts like the Mahabharata, Ramayana, and Manusmriti, which he believed were used to subjugate women and reinforce the caste system. Periyar is also known as the &ldquo;Father of the Dravidian movement&rdquo;. The Self-Respect Movement and Dravidar Kazhagam were both started by Periyar. Many political parties in Tamil Nadu, including the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), have their origins in the Self-Respect Movement.</li>\r\n\t<li>In 1968, the state of Tamil Nadu legalized the Self-Respect Marriage Law, also known as Suyamariyathai. This law allows two Hindus to marry without a Brahmin priest or elaborate rituals, in the presence of friends or relatives. The first self-respect marriage took place in 1928, officiated by Periyar himself. Periyar encouraged inter caste marriages based on equality and respect.</li>\r\n</ul>","solution_image_1":"","solution_image_2":"","solution_video":"","difficulty_level":"1","topic":"","exam":"","section_id":"313","subject":"","concept":"","report_count":"0","set_no":"1","positive_marks":"2.00","negative_marks":"0.66","sortingparam":"0.00","question_heading":"","directive":"","deleted":"0","image_check":"0"}]
